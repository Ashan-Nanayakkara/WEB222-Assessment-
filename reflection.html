                    <h1>Explain the concept of Responsive Design</h1>
                    <p> So when it comes to theResponsive design is a method of creating web pages that use flexible
                        layouts, flexible graphics,
                        and media queries in
                        the form of cascading style sheets. The purpose of responsive design is to create web pages that
                        recognize the size and
                        orientation of the visitor's screen and adjust the layout appropriately.
                        <br>
                        Responsive design seems to be a rather retro approach to website design and development that
                        addresses many of the
                        design issues that have arisen as a result of the growth of new sorts of mobile devices. Instead
                        of fixed-width
                        settings, responsive design websites employ X and Y coordinates on a grid for design and
                        mathematical percentages for
                        pictures. Using percentages so rather than fixed-width parameters with a grid layout results in
                        a somewhat more fluid
                        layout that adapts to the size of the display.
                        <br>
                        The developer may determine when a certain style takes effect using media queries, a component
                        of cascading style sheets
                        (CSS). A media query in CSS2, for example, will supply printer-friendly style sheets if they are
                        requested. CSS3 offers
                        improved query capabilities, allowing style sheets to be tailored to the display of a device and
                        served as a desktop,
                        tablet, or smartphone style sheet based on the query result.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>How does responsive design relate to web technologies</h1>
                    <p>Responsive design is a method of creating web properties such that the device on which they are
                        viewed dictates how the
                        site is presented. It's usually done according to the "mobile first" philosophy, which means
                        that the experience is
                        first designed on mobile platforms like smartphones and tablets, then scaled up to bigger
                        displays.
                        <br>
                        The necessity for this strategy stems from the realization that an increasing number of people
                        are browsing the mobile
                        web, and that smartphone internet access currently outnumbers conventional PC access in several
                        areas. Touchscreens, GPS
                        data, accelerometers, and other features on mobile devices are also available in desktop/laptop
                        settings.
                    </p>

                    <h1>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your
                        research?</h1>
                    <p>Users may scroll or click to absorb more information on traditional websites, or they may provide
                        an email address or
                        other private details for an online transaction.

                        A web app, on the other hand, improves the user experience (UX) so that users can do much more.
                        To manage these types of
                        interactions, web applications must be dynamically updated.</p>
                    <h1>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course</h1>
                    <p>Basically, I have learned so many new things about the css, html and web development in general
                        throughout this
                        assignment. When it comes to the challenging parts the Js validations was bit of tough and it
                        was something I had to
                        spend more time on when it comes to the other section of the assignment. Building a web site is
                        really a good way to
                        brush up and master the web technologies so throughout this assignment is was a whole new
                        experience.
                        .
